# Machine Learning
**Taken on: Coursera**

**Instructor: Andrew Ng**

**[Webpage](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)**

Online course completed during 2014-2015. Its goal was to teach the basics of Machine Learning.
This is one of the most instructive and interesting online courses I have taken, and it is [one of the most popular online courses
on the internet](https://www.diygenius.com/the-50-most-popular-courses-on-coursera/).

The course was heavily project based, and although the exercises were not always too challenging, they reveal an easy to follow
path to understand the tools available for data scientists. The projects included different algorithms in machine learning.,
which can easily be extended and tweacked to target different problems. Most of them were coded in Matlab. Enjoy!
